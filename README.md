# kanban-next

**kanban-next** is a personal project created by Andrew Bubnov with Next 13, Material-UI, and custom drag-and-drop functionality to build a Kanban-style task management application. It features user authentication with multiple options, including Google, Facebook, or email and password registration.

## Features

- **Custom Drag-and-Drop:** The application includes a custom drag-and-drop system for moving and organizing task cards. No third-party drag-and-drop libraries are used, giving you full control over the user experience.

- **User Authentication:** Users can register and log in using various methods:
  - Email and password registration.
  - Google Sign-In.
  - Facebook Sign-In.

- **Material-UI Integration:** The project leverages Material-UI for a sleek and modern user interface design. Material-UI provides a wide range of components to create a consistent and responsive user experience.
