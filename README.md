# kanban-next

**kanban-next** is a personal project created by Andrew Bubnov using Next.js 13, Prisma ORM, Material-UI, and custom drag-and-drop functionality to build a Kanban-style task management application. The authentication procedure and direct access to the database provides storing and secure authorized access to individual user's data.

## Features

- **Custom Drag-and-Drop:** The application includes a custom drag-and-drop system for moving and organizing task cards. No third-party drag-and-drop libraries are used, giving you full control over the user experience.

- **Server Actions and Prisma**: This application utilizes server actions, a feature provided by Next.js 13, for direct database access, powered by the Prisma ORM. This enables efficient data operations and interactions with the backend.
 
- **Task Management**: In addition to drag-and-drop functionality, users can view task details and edit them, providing a comprehensive task management experience.

- **Material-UI Integration:** The project leverages Material-UI for a sleek and modern user interface design. Material-UI provides a wide range of components to create a consistent and responsive user experience.
  
- **User Authentication:** Users can register and log in using various methods, including Google, Facebook, or email and password registration.

Usage
Once you have your application running, you can create tasks, drag and drop them to organize, manage your workflow, view task details, and make edits. Users can register and log in using their preferred authentication method.
